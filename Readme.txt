🔍 Problem Statement: Wavelength Calculation using Diffraction

✅ Objective:
To calculate the wavelength (λ) of light using input values for:
- Angle (θ) in degrees  
- Fringe order (m) 
- Slit distance (d) in various units (µm, mm, or m)

🧮 Formula Used: λ = (d × sinθ) / m

Where:  
- λ = Wavelength in nanometers (nm)  
- d = Slit separation  
- θ = Diffraction angle in degrees  
- m = Fringe order

⚙️ How the Program Works

1. Takes user input for angle (in degrees)
2. Converts angle to radians
3. Takes fringe order (m)
4. Accepts slit distance (d) in chosen unit
5. Applies the formula to calculate λ in nanometers
6. Determines the color of light based on the calculated wavelength

🌈 Color Classification (Based on λ)

| Range (nm)      | Color     |
|-----------------|-----------|
| 380 – 450       | Violet    |
| 450 – 485       | Blue      |
| 485 – 500       | Cyan      |
| 500 – 565       | Green     |
| 565 – 590       | Yellow    |
| 590 – 625       | Orange    |
| 625 – 750       | Red       |
